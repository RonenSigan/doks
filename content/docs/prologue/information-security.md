The Payment Card Industry (PCI) has established strict security requirements for the processing, handling, transmission and storage of sensitive data that is required for processing card transactions when the card is not present. The requirements are set forth in the PCI Data Security Standard (DSS). Rapyd has passed stringent independent onsite assessments by a Qualified Security Assessor and is certified as a Level 1 service provider. 

Rapyd and PCI-compliant clients can handle the following sensitive personal data:
* Name
* Card number
* Expiration date
* Card security code (CVV)

Clients without PCI certification must not collect any sensitive personal data and cannot use features of the Rapyd platform that require that data. To handle card transactions without PCI certification, use the Rapyd Checkout Page. See [Checkout Page Object](ref:checkout-page-object).

The International Organization for Standardization (ISO) and the International Electrotechnical Commission have formulated specific requirements for information security management systems. These requirements are contained in the ISO/IEC 27001 standard, as updated in 2013. The British Standards Institution (BSI), an independent, accredited registrar, has audited Rapyd's information security management system and Rapyd has earned the BSI Information Security Certification.
